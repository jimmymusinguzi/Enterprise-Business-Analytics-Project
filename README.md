This project used the  Coffee Quality Dataset, collected by the Coffee Quality Institute in January 2018. The data was collected on Arabica coffee beans from across the world and professionally rated on a 0-100 scale based on factors like acidity, sweetness, fragrance, balance, etc. The dataset also contained information about coffee bean origin country, harvesting and grading date, colour, defects, processing and packaging details.

Analyzing this dataset is very crucial since Uganda is one of the leading exporters of Arabica Coffee which is extremely competitive on the international market. The crop is mainly grown in slightly raised areas and in Uganda it is mainly grown in areas like the Rwenzori Mountains, mountain Elgon and the west Nile region. The coffee varieties that are grown in Uganda include Robusta-screen 15, Arabica-Bugisu A, Arabica- Bugisu AA, Arabica-Bugisu PB, Arabica â€“Drugar and Arabica-Bugisu B. In 2023, Uganda exported 74,235 bags of Arabica valued at US $16.68 million.
